Data Science and MLOps Landscape in Industry

This projet is about exploring the Data Science and MLOps Landscape in Industry. It is an invaluable resource for anyone interested in data manipulation, visualization, and in-depth analysis, including geospatial exploration. Through this project, I gained practical skills in utilizing a wide range of visualization techniques, such as box plots, doughnut charts, bar charts, heatmaps, parallel categorical graphs, bubble charts, funnel charts, radar charts, icicle charts, and maps. Additionally, I developed the ability to effectively analyze and interpret different types of graphs, enabling me to extract meaningful insights from the data.
